# iot-iotcommons

This is my private library of components to improve the C++ IoT development.

## Problem statement

I am big fan of ESP8266, ESP32 and NodeMCU development. I also like how many various examples/software tools the community provided for the above-mentioned devices.

However, most of the code examples and implementations are pretty naive - they do not include error-handling and never assume that Your device may lose network connectivity overtime. I found no single example of the code that handled it gently.

Therefore, I created my own set of tools to address the issue.

## Implementation

TBD
